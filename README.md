# Discord Bot
This is a basic discord bot for a minecraft server

I`ve created this bot for a Minecraft server that I is hosted on an extra Windows computer that I have at home, that is why I have a function that returns the public IP of where the bot is and a function to execute the run.bat file with username and password.

It is developed in the Trae IDE and retouched with the built-in AI to fix errors.
